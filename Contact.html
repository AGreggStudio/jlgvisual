	<h4>Over the last 5 years, I have considered the nature of ‘Visibility’.  Everyone experiences their environment differently. Although we all see we don’t all notice the same information. Although the full package is before us, we notice and react differently. Better known as Visual Literacy. <br> <br>

We are creators, with social media dominating society and a privileged access to evolving technology.  How does a non-visual person create?  Will learning design improve Visual Literacy?  This is a personal exploration.<br><br>

During this time in a pandemic, even the most visible in society is exploring the invisible life.  What is it like to not be noticed?  Does sharing the internal or invisible to the public depend on personality or culture?  If so, aren’t you curious. Many struggle to be visible and part of society. Some as a minority population, some from the mainstream. <br><br>

This website is an outcome of thinking about ‘Visibility’.  UI design manages viewers browsing through visible patterns.  Coding includes the Visibility Element (note the hamburger icon at the top of the page).  In photography, I push myself to see elements of design in the world.  In motion design, different movements require different responses through visual triggers.  A ‘Nod’, a tip of your head connects quickly and is short-lived.  A ‘Summon’, is an invitation to look more closely.  A ‘Yarn’, a tale or story requires viewers to take time to view and listen.  The Project page on this website shows a few projects from my life that have gone public.  Publishing work envisages the work and the maker.  The final experiment is to see whether this website is viewed or this paragraph read.  Has Search Engine Optimization worked?  If so, send a message on the Contact form and make your presence visible.  Give a Nod to your experience. Thanks.<br><br></h4>
