	<h4>Since 2015 I have been thinking about the nature of ‘Visibility’.  Everyone’s experience is personal.  We notice and react differently to similar encounters. The 1972 book, ‘Ways of Seeing’ by John Berger explains how an individual’s response to an artwork depends on personal knowledge, background and education. Looking also depends on Visual Literacy, our ability and skill in interpreting and developing meaning of the image.<br> <br>
We are creators, living in society saturated with social media.  Everyone is a photographer with unlimited editing potential.  Technology makes it easy.  A person considering themselves non-visual might need to consider basic design concepts to improve visual literacy.  For me this has been a stimulating personal exploration.<br><br>

Visibility is a highly charged political term.  Protests and outrage surround the rights of people who remain invisible in the mainstream. Visibility can also be explored within a psychological framework. The journey to discover your inner self brings light to the invisible. The 2020-2! pandemic has limited social interactions and many people have become individually resourceful during their isolation.  In some ways, this has been a psychological journey.  Defining visibility has to be multi-layered. The spectrum of this visible and invisible duality is both personal and situational.    <br><br>

This website reflects my thinking about ‘Visibility’.  UI Design manages how viewers browse by creating patterns of use.  Coding includes the Visibility Element (note the hamburger icon at the top of the page).  In photography, I push myself to see design elements in the world.  In motion design, different movements require different responses from visual triggers.  A ‘Nod’, a tip of your head connects quickly and is short-lived.  A ‘Summon’, is an invitation to look more closely.  A ‘Yarn’, a tale or story requires viewers to take more time to view and listen.  The Project page on this website shows a few projects made public.  Publishing means becoming visible.   The final experiment is to see whether this website is viewed or this paragraph read.
